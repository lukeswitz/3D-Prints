Krrawn's Wardriver Case v0.2

This is a printable case for the Jhewitt wardriver (https://jhewitt.net/portable_wardriver)

Can be printed FDM or Resin, whichever you have or feel comfortable with. 

In the ZIP there is a suggested print orientation but feel free to print however your printer/material works best. 

Walls and infil do not matter much, dealers choice. 

you will need to install the bulk head connectors for the antennas first and then lift/move the wires out of the way for the board install. The screen will clip into the lid using the nibs for retention
Lid is retained with 4x m3 between 6mm and 10mm in length.
